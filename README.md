# Introduction
## Background
ACLO, one of the largest student sports accosiation in Groningen, Netherlands, currently has more than 19,000 cardholders.
With a regular card, a cardholder can make use of group lessons, courses and open hours. A cardholder who wants to use the fitness in the Sports Centre in addition to the regular sports offer, must purchase a Fitness Card, in addition to the regular card. The percentage of cardholders who have a Fitness Card is relatively low. 

## Goal
To increase the number of fitness users and other ways to promote the Fitness Card. For example, since August 31, 2020, it is possible to use the fitness in the weekends and university holidays with only a regular ACLO card.

## Challenge
Based on the use of the Fitness, predict the number of visitors to the Fitness, taking into account the influence of 
1.  Seasons
2.  Holidays
3.  The day of the week
4.  Gender
5.  Educational institution (Hanze vs. UG)
6.  Exam periods for the UG students.

## Data Resource
The ACLO fitness usage data is directly provided by ACLO

The holiday period of the Netherland and the exam period of both educational institution is based on RUG's academic calendar, since Hanze calendar is not accessable before 2023.

The covid lockdown period in Netherlands is according to this graph

As for the weather data, it's from this free database:

Since they have no data of Groningen, I picked the nearest city De Bilt. For the Temperature in April 2025, it is estimated by KNMI. From May to July, since it hasn't been estimated, I calculated the history average during that day of the year and apply to them.

## Model Evaluation
In this following project, we will adopt these measuring matrixes
1.  Mean Absolute Error:
    The average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, less sensitive to outliers
2.  Mean Squared Error: 
    The average squared difference between predicted and actual values, sensitive to outliers
3.  R-squared:
    The proportion of the variance in y that is predictable from x
4.  Adjusted R-squared: 
    Modifies the R-squared value based on the number of predictors and the sample size.
